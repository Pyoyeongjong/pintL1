# PINT_L1 (Archived)

A Layer 1 blockchain system that implements general state transition logic, block production, and tx validation for practicing purposes using Rust.

## Status
**This project has been archived.**

The development is paused due to the lack of an initial, well-defined architecture design.  
While using [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) as a reference, I found the codebase too large and complex to directly follow for this learning purpose.

## Next Steps
I decided to start a **new blockchain project** from scratch with a much simpler and thinner architecture, focusing only on the minimal components required for a functional single-node chain.
